# Generating a Yelp Profile
The purpose of our project is to develop a web application that scrapes consumer reviews on Yelp to build profiles that showcase their knowledge and expertise. Additionally, the research will utilize natural language processing to analyze data and build user profiles. As a result, Yelp users will be able to share their profiles over social media, which will further incentivize them to continue reviewing and contributing quality content.
